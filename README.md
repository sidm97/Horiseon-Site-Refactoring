# <Horiseon-webpage-refactored>

## Description

This project is based on HTML coded by someone else for Horiseon's landing page. I started working on this code as a result of an on-the-job ticket from the above marketing agency. While their landing page HTML was function it did not meet accessibility standards. I restructured the HTML and CSS pages to make them more accessible and more easily read to improve search engine optimization. It was a useful exercise in learning how to appropriately structure both HTML and CSS sheets.

## Installation

No installation necessary, simply use the following link to access the website landing page: https://sidm97.github.io/Module-1-Challenge/

## Usage

The only "moving parts" to the landing page are the 3 links on the navigation bar, that lead to the section headers below on the same page.

## Credits

Credit to the original designer of the webpage, they made the code, I merely restructured it. Credit to the bootcamp's previous lessons too which were helpful in working out what the optimal "accessible" sheets should look like.

## License

I've chosen the MIT license
